Welcome to ENIIGMA fitting tool documentation!
========================================
Introduction
------------

ENIIGMA is a Python code for the d(**E**)compositio(**N**) of (**I**)nfrared (**I**)ce spectra using (**G**)enetic (**M**)odelling (**A**)lgorithm.

An internal library containing infrared spectrum of ice data taken from public databases is used to deompose the input spectra.

The genetic algorithm module run the Pyevolve Python package and give the global minimum solution for the spectral decomposition after several generations. More about `Pyevolve <http://pyevolve.sourceforge.net/0_6rc1/>`_.

Once the ENIIGMA fitting tool has finished the spectral decomposition, an statistical can be performed to calculate: 1. the confidence interval, 2. the ice column density,
and 3. the degeneracy using pie chart and histograms.

Other functionalities of the ENIIGMA fitting tool regards to the spectral continuum calculation by polynomial and blackbody fitting.  

Features:
-----------

The ENIIGMA fitting tool is focused on the spectral decomposition of the observational IR spectra containing absorption ice features. So far, the *Spitzer* and VLT/ISAAC spectra
have been successfully tested. In this regard, this code will be useful to provide an unbiased analysis of the upcoming *James Webb Space Telescope - JWST* data.
